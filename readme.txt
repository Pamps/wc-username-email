Set the username as the actual email address, on WooCommerce account creation.

== Description ==

WooCommerce has a setting entitled "Automatically generate username from customer email".  
This setting creates a username based on your email address.
So my_email_address@gmail.com become a username of my_email_address

This plugin extends that feature and makes the username the full email address.
i.e. the username becomes my_email_address@gmail.com
